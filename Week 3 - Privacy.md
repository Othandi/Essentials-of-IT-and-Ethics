# Week 3 - Privacy

## Privacy as a Global Principle

### Foundation in Human Rights
**The principle of privacy is global law**

Seen in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights:

*"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation."*

**Scope**: This extends both to governments and the treatment of customers, suppliers etc.

## Privacy and Personal Data

### Historical Context
In the context of computing, this typically emerged in the 1980s as digital processing of information grew:

- **Australia's Privacy Act (1988)**
- **United Kingdom's Data Protection Act (1984)**

### Evolution of Privacy Law
Most privacy laws have been revised several times to cover:
- More uses and forms of data (e.g. non-digital data)
- New rights (e.g. "right to be forgotten" in E.U.)

## Confidentiality and Data

### Core Data Protection Principles
In principle, all personal data must be:

- **Kept confidential** (cannot be shared*)
- **Used for a specific purpose** (and only that)
- **Accurate**

*These are data protection or privacy principles*

**Note**: Most legislation contains core principles that must be followed with all personal data

## Privacy Principles

### Australian Privacy Act - Thirteen Principles:

1. **Open and transparent management of personal information**
2. **Anonymity and pseudonymity**
3. **Collection of solicited personal information**
4. **Dealing with unsolicited personal information**
5. **Notification of the collection of personal information**
6. **Use or disclosure of personal information**
7. **Direct marketing**
8. **Cross-border disclosure of personal information**
9. **Adoption, use or disclosure of government related identifiers**
10. **Quality of personal information**
11. **Security of personal information**
12. **Access to personal information**
13. **Correction of personal information**

### Key Implementation Requirements:

- **Every principle should be complied with**
- **Principles can be in tension with each other**
- **Breaking a principle cannot be justified by fulfilling another**
- **An organisation needs to have explicit policies and practices** to meet the principles in their context
- **Compliance includes checking that those policies are actually used as intended**

## Personal and Sensitive Data

### Definition of Personal Data
All data about a person is "personal data"

### Sensitive Data Categories
Some of that data is "sensitive data":

- Racial or ethnic origin
- Political opinions or associations
- Religious or philosophical beliefs
- Trade union membership or associations
- Sexual orientation or practices
- Criminal record
- Health or genetic information
- (Some aspects of) biometric information

## Privacy Principle 1: Open and Transparent Management

### Principle 1: Open and transparent management of personal information

- This is a large foundational principle that underpins the other 12
- Personal data policies should be explicitly documented
- That this documentation should be readily available for any data you gather about a person (e.g. customer, member)
- The documentation must demonstrate compliance with the APPs

### Privacy Principle 1: Policy Content

The policy must include:

- The kinds of personal information collected and held by the entity (APP 1.4(a))
- How personal information is collected and held (APP 1.4(b))
- The purposes for which personal information is collected, held, used and disclosed (APP 1.4(c))
- How an individual may access their personal information and seek its correction (APP 1.4(d))
- How an individual may complain if the entity breaches the APPs or any registered binding APP code, and how the complaint will be handled (APP 1.4(e))
- Whether the entity is likely to disclose personal information to overseas recipients (APP 1.4(f)), and if so, the countries in which such recipients are likely to be located if it is practicable to specify those countries in the policy (APP 1.4(g))

### Privacy Principle 1: Policy Compliance

**This sounds simple**

**But practically, in terms of both policy and ethics, this is hard**

**For example:**
- You can't change your mind about a policy and make retrospective changes
- You have to ensure you comply with all APPs and show HOW you ensure that compliance
- It sets obligations on you that you have to fulfill (e.g. how to supply to someone the data that you have on them, and how to correct that if wrong)

## Privacy Principle 3: Solicited Information

Solicited information is information given by an individual at your (organisation's) request

The data in our problem was likely to be solicited information

**Example (sub-) principles include:**

**3.2** If an APP entity is an organisation, the entity must not collect personal information (other than sensitive information) unless the information is reasonably necessary for one or more of the entity's functions or activities.

**3.5** An APP entity must collect personal information only by lawful and fair means.

## Privacy and Global Settings

### International Complexity
- **Different countries have different privacy laws**
- **Moving data between countries has privacy implications** (and sometimes other legal issues too)
- **Which country's laws apply when data is gathered varies** (e.g. where the customer is, where the company is based)
- **You can't just choose a "convenient" country with weak privacy laws to avoid compliance**
- **For an organisation, generally where it is based determines which laws it must comply with**
- **For people for some countries, you also have to comply with their country's laws**

### Cross-Border Data Transfer
- **International businesses have to move data between countries**
- **This is generally allowed provided that the protections are equivalent, and if the higher standard is followed for any differences**
- **However, this does increase operational complexity as you need to comply (potentially) with multiple laws**

### Specific Privacy Laws Examples
Some countries have specific privacy laws:

- **New Zealand has specific laws that apply to information about Māori (the indigenous people of NZ)**
- **The European Union has "the right to be forgotten"**

### Important Principle
**Moving data between countries should not and can not be used to circumvent restrictions in a country**

**Remember the "or equivalent" requirement**

**For example:**
- NZ laws have specific protection for Māori
- If data moves to (for example) Australia, those protections must be met; if not the protections are not equivalent

## Accessing Information

### Right to Access
**A key requirement of privacy laws is that individuals can view and correct data held about them**

**This is also found in the APPs (as well as UK, EU, NZ law)**

- In Australia, this is governed by **APP 12**

### Implementation Considerations
- What steps do you think an organisation should take if asked for information about a person?
- What could some practical challenges be in providing it?
- Identify three and put them in order of importance (most important first)

## Correcting Information

### Accuracy Requirement
**Information held about a person must be correct**

- Corrections are governed by **APP 13**
- This can be complicated where there is a dispute about facts
- **Either party (individual or organisation) can initiate correction**
- In large collections of personal data, especially long-lived data, errors are common as data changes (e.g. addresses)
- Good data practice anticipates these risks & manages them

### Key Question
**Question: how could you ensure data is current and correct?**

## Complying with the APPs

### Scope of Application
- **The APPs only apply to larger bodies (> $3m per year turnover)**
- **They also apply to any organisation that shares data externally**
- **Even if compliance is not mandatory individuals can sue for losses caused by poor privacy handling**
- **Voluntary compliance can be a good defence against that risk** (what is termed the "reasonable measures" defence)

### Government Bodies
- **Government bodies are exempt, but are covered by equivalent legislation** (e.g. the Victorian government's Privacy Act)
- **Compliance is overseen by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner**

## Privacy and Professional Practice

### Principle of Parsimony
**A key principle of professional practice Europe, North America and Australasia is the principle of 'parsimony'**

**We should gather and keep:**

- **Only data that is strictly necessary**
- **Only retain it for long enough as is strictly necessary** (e.g. 5 years is a common rule as that is required for all business records in many countries)
- **Ensure all data is backed up so that it is not lost**
- **Ensure all data is secured by multiple methods**
