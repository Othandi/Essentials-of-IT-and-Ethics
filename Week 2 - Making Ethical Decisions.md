# Week 2 - Making Ethical Decisions

## A Framework for Decision-Making

A systematic approach to ethical decision-making with five key steps:

1. **Identify the Ethical Issues**
2. **Get the Facts**
3. **Evaluate Alternative Actions**
4. **Choose an Option for Action and Test It**
5. **Implement your Decision and Reflect on the Outcome**

## Detailed Framework Steps

### Step 1: Identify the Ethical Issues

**Key Questions:**
1. Could this decision or situation be damaging to someone or to some group, or unevenly beneficial to people? Does this decision involve a choice between a good and bad alternative, or perhaps between two "goods" or between two "bads"?

2. Is this issue about more than solely what is legal or what is most efficient? If so, how?

### Step 2: Get the Facts

**Key Questions:**
3. What are the relevant facts of the case? What facts are not known? Can I learn more about the situation? Do I know enough to make a decision?

4. What individuals and groups have an important stake in the outcome? Are the concerns of some of those individuals or groups more important? Why?

5. What are the options for acting? Have all the relevant persons and groups been consulted? Have I identified creative options?

### Step 3: Evaluate Alternative Actions

**Question 6:** Evaluate the options by asking the following questions:

#### The Six Ethical Lenses:

- **The Rights Lens**: Which option best respects the rights of all who have a stake?

- **The Justice Lens**: Which option treats people fairly, giving them each what they are due?

- **The Utilitarian Lens**: Which option will produce the most good and do the least harm for as many stakeholders as possible?

- **The Common Good Lens**: Which option best serves the community as a whole, not just some members?

- **The Virtue Lens**: Which option leads me to act as the sort of person I want to be?

- **The Care Ethics Lens**: Which option appropriately takes into account the relationships, concerns, and feelings of all stakeholders?

### Step 4: Choose an Option for Action and Test It

**Key Questions:**
7. After an evaluation using all of these lenses, which option best addresses the situation?

8. If I told someone I respect (or a public audience) which option I have chosen, what would they say?

9. How can my decision be implemented with the greatest care and attention to the concerns of all stakeholders?

### Step 5: Implement Your Decision and Reflect on the Outcome

**Key Question:**
10. How did my decision turn out, and what have I learned from this specific situation? What (if any) follow-up actions should I take?

## Whistleblowing (Review)

### Definition
"Blowing the whistle on your own team"

### Three Components:
- **Dissent**: "whistle blowing makes public a disagreement with an authority of a majority view" – specifically shedding light on negligence or abuse
- **Breach of loyalty** (e.g., to colleagues, employer, client, government)
- **Accusation concerning a threat that is specific, concrete, and present/imminent**

### Key Considerations: When, Where, How, Why?
- Would whistleblowing be in the public interest? (consider **information hazards**)
- Responsibilities to employer/colleagues vs. benefits to public?
- Risks to your safety, your career, and your family?

## Stakeholders and Communication

### Who are the Stakeholders?

- **Professional** (employees – you and your colleagues)
- **Organisational** (managers, executives, shareholders)
- **Consumers** (clients, direct end-users)
- **Third parties** (professional disciplines, broader society, unintentional users)

### Stakeholder Mapping

A framework for analyzing stakeholders based on two dimensions:

**Power**: The ability of a stakeholder to influence an organisation strategy or project resources

**Interest**: How interested they are in the organisation or project

#### Four Categories:

- **A - Minimal Effort** (Low Power, Low Interest): Require minimal effort
- **B - Keep Informed** (Low Power, High Interest): Keep these stakeholders informed
- **C - Keep Satisfied** (High Power, Low Interest): Keep these stakeholders satisfied
- **D - Key Players** (High Power, High Interest): These are your key players - manage closely

## Communicating About Ethics

### Best Practices for Ethical Communication:

- **Combat rationalisation and cognitive distancing** – these are bad reasons to stay silent
- **Consult professional and legal standards** for guidance and refer to these in your communication
- **Seek counsel from others** to counter bias. Source a range of perspectives
- **Weigh the actual pros and cons** of speaking up
- **Consider ways to address the issue that minimize potential harm**. E.g., can you talk to the people involved as a first intervention?
- **Rehearse difficult conversations** with a confidant first
- **Listen with an open mind**. Avoid making accusations – ask questions first
- **Escalate to someone senior** if required
- **Protect yourself** – document ethical decisions and discussions

## The Business Case for Ethics

### Why should your employer care about ethical practice?

- **Builds community trust and good will**
- **Consistent and dependable operation**
- **Aligns with ethical corporate values/expectations**
- **Protects against potential legal prosecution**
- **Avoids negative press**

### Application
Consider how you (as an employee or service provider) might incorporate these arguments when advocating an ethical stance or raising an ethical concern.
