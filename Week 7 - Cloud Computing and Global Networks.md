# Week 7 - Cloud Computing and Global Networks

## What is Cloud Computing?
- it's an on-demand access of computing resources — physical servers or virtual servers, data storage, networking capabilities, application development tools, software, AI-powered analytic tools and more — over the internet with pay-per-use pricing

## Cloud-based Data Systems
- data is stored across multiple servers, not just locally
- storage may be temporary or dynamic
- internet connectivity is essential for access
- enables seamless data coordination across devices
- offers computing power beyond what a typical laptop or PC can handle

## Types of Cloud Services
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
    - software applications delivered over the internet

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
    - virtualized computing resources over the internet

- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    - cloud platform for developing, running, and managing applications

## Cloud Computing and Personal Data
- remember that personal data should reside within particular countries or 'legislatures'
- moving data between countries can be legally complex
- the cloud service provider only knows you have data — they cannot know what type of data you have

## Inequality in Cloud Computing
- customers and users have different levels of access to cloud services
- some may be closer to data centers, resulting in faster access and lower latency
- others may face higher costs or slower access due to their location
- the systems controlling the cloud may also treat them differently

- this is an ethical issue for anyone providing or using cloud services; it impacts:
    - Charging models
    - Service-level agreements (SLAs)
    - Demand and use of the cloud services

## Cloud Computing Models and Ethics
- Edge Computing:
    - decentralises server locations to reduce latency and improve efficiency
    - shifts computation closer to the user's device
    - however, device power restricts how much can be processed locally

- Infrastructure Costs:
    - includes money, electricity, maintenance, and space
    - more advanced solutions = higher costs

- Trade-offs:
    - better performance often comes with greater expense
    - decisions involve both economic and ethical considerations

## Ethical Resource Allocation
- Beyond Economics:
    - companies may intentionally incur losses in certrain regions 
    - its purpose is to ensure equal treatment and build customer trust globally

- Customer Mobility:
    - supporting users who move countries temporarily helps maintain service consistency
    - it also reduces perceived drop in service quality

- Ethical Targeting:
    - deciding where and how to allocate cloud resources is an ethical issue
    - balancing fairness, accessibiity, and business goals

## Cloud Computing: Bias
- there are criticisms that cloud has a bias in favour of:
    - Richer people  (who have better access to technology)
    - White people (who are generally wealthier)
    - Men (ditto)
    - Corporates (who set the terms and conditions)
    - and also that cloud computing is environmentally unfriendly

- even in developed post-industrial economies, there are disparities that cloud coincides with:
    - 97% of USA citizens have internet access
    - 66% have a laptop or desktop computer
    - 30% only have a smartphone
    - on those earning less than $30,000 a year, 14% only have an old basic mobile phone

## Internet Services: Bias
- even if web access to services have been taken away, there are still many people who cannot access them
- this is an ethical and practical issue for:
    - government services (who have a duty to provide services to all citizens)
    - large businesses who want to reach the whole public
    - charities trying to support marginalised groups, who will disproportionately be affected
