# Week 4 - Security

## Security
- **Privacy**: is legally found on human rights
- **Security**: is usually an obligation placed on organisations less directly, for example:
    - As a consequence of privacy legislation
    - Requirements and limitations of liability insurance
    - Operational needs to retain high availability and working IT systems

### Security and Privacy Laws
- privacy laws usually require dat to be kept secure from inadvertent disclosure:
    - Australian Privacy Principles (APPs), Principle 11
    - EU General Data Protection Regulation 
- the detail of required security controls varies substantially between countries (which is one of the challenges when sending data between countries)

## Australian Privacy Principle 11
**11.1** The entity must take such steps that are reasonable in the circumstances to protect the information:
    **a.** from misuse, interference and loss; and
    **b.** from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure

**11.2** If an entity holds personal information about an individual; and
    **a.** the entity no longer needs the information for any purpose for which the information may be used or disclosed by the entity under this Schedule; and
    **b.** the information is not contained in a Commonwealth record; and
    **c.** the entity is not required by or under an Australian law, or a court/tribunal order, to retain the information;
- the entity must take such steps that are reasonable in the circumstances to destroy the information or to ensure that the information is de-identified

### Security and the Law
- essentially, data must be kept secure and when no longer needed, it must be destroyed confidentially
- however, many IT companies lack detailed knowledge of security risks, and furthermore how to secure against those risks
- technical issues are also a part of the problem, but poor security practices done daily by people are the bigger threat

### Security and Ethics
- security raises a number of ethical considerations:
    - Respecting people (rights, privacy, and confidentiality)
    - Ensuring justice (avoid bias and discrimination)
    - Respecting the law and public interest by disclosing breaches, responding rapidly to found weaknesses, and managing conflicts of interest

## Ethics and Security - Hats
- two terms often used in security are:
    - **White hat**: are hackers who seek to find security vulnerabilities to have them fixed, often with (later) public coverage once patches are available with the aim to improve public online safety
    - **Black hat**: are hackers who seek to breach security protocols either to further their own interests (financial or political) or for pure entertainment, without reference to public interest

## Australian Privacy Principle 7 - Direct Marketing
- privacy principles are only the start of ethical considerations
- coming up with specific action to meet the principles is a separate piece of work
- IT professionals at all levels have to support compliance

### Direct Marketing
- in data protection terms, direct marketing is the activityy of sending marketing materials that consider them a *"good match"*
- companies that hold direct marketing information sometimes sell the personal data they hold to other organisations, which means that companies can gather information that might be useful but is not certainly or maybe even not likely to be useful
