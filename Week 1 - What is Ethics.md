# What is Ethics?

## Definition of Ethics

- **Branch of philosophy**
- **Ethical lenses define principles of right and wrong** that individuals can use to make choices
- These concepts are often tied in with other values, such as what is important to individuals or societies
- **Ethical and legal are not the same thing**

### Key Questions to Consider:
- Can you think of a scenario in which doing something **illegal** could be seen as the more **ethical** option?
- Can you think of a behaviour that is technically **legal**, but **unethical**?

## Why Should You Study Ethics?

□ **Understanding Values**: Studying ethics helps us better understand our own values, and the values of those around us

□ **Complex Decision Making**: Decisions can be complex or carry risk – ethical frameworks can help us evaluate risks and benefits from multiple perspectives

□ **Professional Accountability**: Ethics frameworks can improve accountability and transparency in professional decision-making

□ **Technology Challenges**: Computing technologies introduce new ethical complexity (e.g., privacy, IP, immediacy, internationality, content modification, cybercrime) (Barger, 2008)

## Discipline Ethics: ICT

## Personal vs. Professional Ethics

### Ethical Conflicts
What happens when your personal values conflict with:
- Work tasks or workplace requests?
- Professional ethics standards or legal obligations?

### Managing Personal and Professional Values
- **Personal ethics can be bounded, communicated, and/or matched for compatibility**
- **Communicating your own values** – e.g., CV, LinkedIn, social media footprint
- **Evaluating organisational values** – e.g., mission statement, past projects, current employees

## Whistleblowing

### Definition
"Blowing the whistle on your own team"

### Three Components:
1. **Dissent**: "whistle blowing makes public a disagreement with an authority of a majority view" – specifically shedding light on negligence or abuse
2. **Breach of loyalty** (e.g., to colleagues, employer, client, government)
3. **Accusation concerning a threat that is specific, concrete, and present/imminent**

### Key Considerations: When, Where, How, Why?
- Would whistleblowing be in the public interest? (consider **information hazards**)
- Responsibilities to employer/colleagues vs. benefits to public?
- Risks to your safety, your career, and your family?
