# Week 5 - IT Regulations and Laws

## Copyright in IT
- Copyright is a legal concept that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights to its use and distribution, usually for a limited time, with the intention of enabling the creator to receive compensation for their intellectual investment
- Rights usually include:
    - attribution
    - commercial use
    - licensing
- Ownership is usually the following:
    - it depends on employment/contract terms
    - buying software = licensing, not ownership
    - modifying software may be illegal under recent laws
- Public domain is when once copyright expires, works can be freely used. This is usually 70 years after the death of the creator, but varies by country.

### Pros and Cons of Copyright
- Pros:
    - encourages creativity and innovation
    - economic incentive
    - control and recognition

- Cons in the Digital Era:
    - limit access to knowledge
    - preservation issues (e.g. obsolete formats)
    - may stifle innovation

## Copyright and Data
- data can be protected by copyright if it meets the criteria of originality and creativity
- it usually protects:
    - confidential data
    - visuals like photos and artwork
    - web content
- although concerns include:
    - reinvention leading to bugs 
    - weak protection encourages poor coding practices

## Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
- FOSS is software that is both free to use and open for anyone to inspect, modify, and distribute
- it is usually developed collaboratively and shared under licenses that promote freedom and community involvement

- Open Source Principles include:
    - access to source code
        - the software's source code is available to everyone
        - users and developers can study how the software works and adapt it to their needs
    - freedom to modify and share
        - users have the freedom to modify the source code
        - this encourages innovation and the adaptation of the software to specific contexts
    - community collaboration
        - open source promots a culture of collaborative development
        - developers and users improve the software, fix bugs, and add new features together
    - permissive licensing
        - open source software is distributed under licenses that respect these freedoms
    - transparency and security
        - access to the source code provides total transparency about how the software works which can lead to increased security as vulnerabilities can be identified and fixed by the community

- Licensing type examples:
    - Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) License - permissive and not attribution required
    - GNU General Public License (GPL) - attribution required, sometimes derivative works must be open source

## Software Patents
- this is a different form of intellectual property. It's conventially for **mechanisms** not software and much of the world only allows them when a software has a "novel" effect on a mechanism

- Global Differences:
    - US: allows software patents and is normally lenient
    - Australia: allows software patents but has limited support
    - China: is expanding to protect AI

- Ethical Issues:
    - patent trolls
    - restrictive licensing
    - barriers to innovation

### LZW Compression and GIF Graphics
- GIFS ( a commong graphics format) use a compression technique called LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) which was patented by Unisys in 1985
    - LZW was an early case of a software patent
    - its effect increased the volume of storage capacity
    - in the early years of the internet, the GIF format was ubiquitous
    - Unisys began enforcing its patent in 1994, leading to controversy and legal disputes 

## Patents and Ethics
- patents are intended to protect those who create intellectual property and defend them against copycat threats
- you can, in principle, licence patents via the inventory. But some use patents to restrict development via hostile pricing or licencing terms

## Trademarks
- its purpose is to protect brand identity and consumer trust by preventing confusion in the marketplace
- its features include:
    - protection of brand names, logos, slogans
    - it doesn't expire
    - "passing off" is illegal
    - registered trademarks offer stronger protection

## Equality Legislation in IT
- equality legislation aims to prevent discrimination and promote equal opportunities in various aspects of life, including employment, education, and access to services

- in Australia there are a variety of commonwealth legislation:
    - Racial Discrimination Act 1975
    - Sex Discrimination Act 1984
    - Disability Discrimination Act 1992
    - Age Discrimination Act 2004
- there's also state legislation like:
    - Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (VIC)

- this impacts both IT workplaces and IT services
- IT has a major problem with either reinforcing bias, marginalising groups, and active hostility towards women, disabled people, LGBTQIA+ people, and different ethnicities

## IT and Accessibility
- technology has an incredible potential to ensure as many people as possible can access products and services
- however, if a site is not designed with accessibility in mind, it can create new avenues for indirect discrimination

### What is Accessibility?
- it is the term used to describe how a product, service, or place can be easily used by as many people as possible. It's about making things usable to all people, whatever their age, abilities, or disabilities

### Accessibility and IT compliance
- it refers to the provision of information and online services through the web that's covered by the DDA. This requirement applies to any individual or organisation developing a website or other web source in Australia or placing or maintaining a web resource on an Australian server

### The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
- WCAG Accessibility Standards:
    - WCAG provides guidelines to make web content accessible for people with various disabilities, ensuring equal access for all uers

- Three Compliance Levels:
    - WCAG defines three levels of compliance:
        - Level A for basic
        - Level AA for mid-range
        - Level AAA for the highest standard

- Benefits of Compliance:
    - meeting WCAG levels improves website usability for everyone and helps organisations meet legal accessibility requirements, such as the DDA in Australia and the European Accessibility Act
